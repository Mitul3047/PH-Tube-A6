                    <li>
                        <span class="font-semibold">var:</span>
                        The scope of a var variable is function scope or global
                        scope. This means that a var variable can be accessed from anywhere within the function where it
                        is declared, or from anywhere in the global scope.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="font-semibold">let:</span>
                        The scope of a let variable is block scope. This means that
                        a let variable can only be accessed from within the block where it is declared.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="font-semibold">const:</span>
                        The scope of a const variable is block scope. This means
                        that a const variable can only be accessed from within the block where it is declared. However,
                        once a const variable is assigned a value, that value cannot be changed.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <span class="font-semibold">null:</span>
                        The value null is used to indicate that a variable does not have a value. For example, you could
                        use null to indicate that a user has not entered a value into a form field.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="font-semibold">undefined:</span>
                        The value undefined is used to indicate that a variable has not been assigned a value yet. For
                        example, the value of a variable is undefined immediately after it is declared.
                    </li>

                     REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. It is an
                    architectural style for designing APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that provides a standard
                    way for accessing and interacting with web services. REST APIs use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT,
                    DELETE) to access resources, and the data is transferred in a format such as JSON or XML.

                    REST APIs are becoming increasingly popular because they are easy to use and understand, and they
                    can be implemented in a variety of programming languages. They are also scalable and reliable,
                    making them a good choice for applications that need to handle a lot of traffic.

                    <li>They are scalable and reliable.</li>

                <h3 class="font-medium">Here are some of the limitations of using REST APIs:</h3>
                <ul class="space-y-4 p-6">
                    <li>They can be complex to design and implement.</li>
                    <li>They can be slow for large amounts of data.</li>
                    <li>They can be difficult to debug.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                Overall, REST APIs are a powerful tool that can be used to build efficient and scalable web
                applications.
